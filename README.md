# Place Cell Simulation

## Introduction
This repository holds the code for the project described in my bachelor thesis titled "Klassifizierung von Bildern mithilfe von un√ºberwachtem Lernen mit Kohonen-Netzen". The goal was to simulate the behaviour of place cells found in the brain of several animals using machine learning. We generate visual data from the perspective of an agent in a simulated maze and use the resulting images for determining the currently activated place unit. This is done by removing the classifier network of a Convolutional Neural Network and using the vector generated by the feature extraction network as input for a Self-organizing Map. The BMU from said SOM then correlates to the activated place unit. For an extensive introduction into this project please refer to the enclosed thesis paper.

## Requirements

The system is split into a frontend running in Unity Version 2020.3 and a backend implemented using Python 3.9. The requirements.txt in the backend directory holds all the utilized python packages.


## Simulation
The simulation can be run by importing the frontend directory as a project into Unity. Open the SampleScene in order to access the maze. After starting the simulation the game view shows the perspective of the agent in the maze. It is possible to move using the W and S keys and turn by using the mouse. It is possible to generate training or test data by pressing the N key which will cause the controls to be disabled and start teleporting the agent to random positions in the maze in order to take images of the game view. The number of generated images can be adjusted in the ScreenshotGenerator Game Object.

In order to determine the currently activated place unit at runtime of the frontend and display the result in the neural network in the top left corner it is necessary to start the backend server before running the simulation. More on that in the next section. The C key toggles a different view displaying a top-down visualization of the place unit activity in the maze.
